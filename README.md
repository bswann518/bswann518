- 👋 Hi, I’m @bswann518
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of contemporary poetry & poetics and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, but I'm not very good at it yet!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that have to do with poetics, especially creative coding; but the caveat is that I'm a beginner.
